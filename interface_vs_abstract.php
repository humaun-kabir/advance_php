    //an abstract class can have only abstract methods or only non-abstract methods or both,but all methods of an interface are abstract by default.
    //an abstract class can declare properties/methods with access specifier, but interface can declare constant properties(no other properties) and methods are by default abstract and public.
    //a class can inherit only one abstract class and multiple inheritance is not possible for abstract class but a class can implement more than one interface and can achieve multiple inheritance.
    //if a class contains even a single abstract method that class must be declare as abstract.
    //in an abstract class, you can defined as well as it's body methods but in the interface you can only define your methods.
